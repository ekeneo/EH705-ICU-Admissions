# Executive Summary 

Using the principles taught during the eHealth 705 course, the ICU Admissions dataset was explored, analyzed and a logistic regression model was created. Logistic regression was used to create a model as the response variable, Status, was categorical, as were several of the predictor variables in this dataset. Using graphs, descriptive statistics and summaries, the attributes were analyzed and recoded if needed, as well as interpreted. Several of the attributes that were focused on related to patient characteristics at admission, as it might be valuable to understand features of an individual's medical situation that might make them more likely to survive or die during an ICU admission.

(include reasons why we did tests, summary of what was found. )
- overview of tests that we performed and some of the results
- maybe include why we chose some of the tests
- since the main predictor variable was vital status, most of the analyses and exploration was about this variable

# About the ICU Admissions Dataset

## Description 

The ICU Admission dataset contains observations of patients that were admitted to an adult intensive care unit (ICU). The response variable of this dataset is Status of patients after admission, that is, whether they lived or died after admission to ICU. A description of the variables is available below.

Number of cases: 200   
Variable Names: 

  1.	ID: ID number of the patient 
  2.	STA: Vital status (0 = Lived, 1 = Died) 
  3.	AGE: Patient's age in years

  9.	INF: Infection probable at ICU admission (0 = No, 1 = Yes) 
  10.	CPR: CPR prior to ICU admission (0 = No, 1 = Yes) 
  11.	SYS: Systolic blood pressure at ICU admission (in mm Hg) 
  12.	HRA: Heart rate at ICU admission (beats/min) 
  13.	PRE: Previous admission to an ICU within 6 months (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

# Reading in the ICU Admissions Dataset
```{r}
ICU <- read.table("./ICUAdmissions.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",", na.strings="NA", dec=".", strip.white=TRUE)
```


## Structure of the ICU dataset  

```{r}
str(ICU)
```

The ICU Admissions dataset consists of 200 observations with 21 variables. From these observations we found;

  1. The dependent variable is the binary variable Vital Status (Status).   
  2. Nineteen possible predictor variables, both discrete and continuous, were also observed. 
  3. Most of the variables are integer but from information about the data, most of the variables can be recoded to factor variables. Several of the variables have two to three levels categories and so while they are numerical, their means do not offer any meaningful information. 
  4. There are only four variables that can be left as numerical variables others can be recoded to categorical/factor variables.  
  5. There are no missing data.  
  

# Recoding Variables
## Converting Numerical Variables to Factor Variables

Attributes that could be recoded as factors included Status, Sex, Race, Service, Cancer, Renal, Infection, CPR, Previous, Type, Fracture, PCO2, PH, PO2, Bicarbonate, Creatinine and Consciousness. Labelling the factor levels with level names helps with comparative analysis and visualization. 

```{r}
ICU <- within(ICU, {
  Status <- factor(Status, labels=c('Lived','Died'))
  Sex <- factor(Sex, labels=c('Male','Female'))
  Race <- factor(Race, labels=c('White','Black','Other'))
  Service <- factor(Service, labels=c('Medical','Surgical'))
  Cancer <- factor(Cancer, labels=c('No','Yes'))
  Renal <- factor(Renal, labels=c('No','Yes'))
  Infection <- factor(Infection, labels=c('No','Yes'))
  CPR <- factor(CPR, labels=c('No','Yes'))
  Previous <- factor(Previous, labels=c('No','Yes'))
  Type <- factor(Type, labels=c('Elective','Emergency'))
  Fracture <- factor(Fracture, labels=c('No','Yes'))
  PCO2 <- factor(PCO2, labels=c('No','Yes'))
  PH <- factor(PH, labels=c('No','Yes'))
  PO2 <- factor(PO2, labels=c('No','Yes'))
  Bicarbonate <- factor(Bicarbonate, labels=c('No','Yes'))
  Creatinine <- factor(Creatinine, labels=c('No','Yes'))
  Consciousness <- factor(Consciousness, labels=c('Conscious','Deep Stupor','Coma'))
})
```

## Recoding Numeric variables into bins 

Several tests required recoding some of our numerical variables into bins. For Age, bins were created using equal count bins. Systolic was binned by blood pressure categories. HeartRate was also binned based on categories of bradycardia and elevated heart rate. the 

Binning of the Age variable with equal-count bins:
```{r}
ICU$Age.binned <- 
  with(ICU, binVariable(Age,
   bins=5, method='proportions', 
  labels=c('Group 1','Group 2','Group 3',
  'Group 4','Group 5')))
```

Binning of the Systolic variable by hypotension and hypertension categories:  
```{r}
ICU <- 
  within(ICU, {
  Systolic.grouped <- Recode(Systolic, 
  '0:80="hypotension"; 80:120="normal"; 120:129="elevated"; 130:139="stage 1 hypertension"; 140:180="stage 2 hypertension"; 180:260="stage 3 hypertension"; ;',
   as.factor=TRUE)
})
```

Binning of the HeartRate variable by groups of bradycardia, normal and elevated heart rate: 
```{r}
ICU <- 
  within(ICU, {
  HeartRate.grouped <- Recode(HeartRate, 
  '0:60="bradycardia"; 60:100="normal"; 100:200="elevated"',
   as.factor=TRUE)
})
```

# Data Exploration - Graphs

## Examining the Variables Distribution

```{r echo=FALSE}
xray:: distributions(ICU)
```

Using the xray package, general trends in the dataset were identified. 

1) There are more male observations in the dataset than females.

2) Many of the admissions to the ICU were emergencies, with a about a quarter of admissions being elective. This could relate to elective surgical procedures where morbidity could have been high or complications occurred. It is unclear whether people would be preemptively admitted to the ICU for high-risk procedures or if these elective admissions could be thought of as unforeseen or emergencies in themselves.

3) Looking at Status, more than 75% of observations lived after their ICU admission. 

4) While the numbers are roughly even, slightly more procedures were surgical. 

5) More admitted patients had no chronic renal failure, no previous admissions to the ICU, fracture, CPR or cancer when admitted. Most admitted patients had  PO2 above or equal to 60, blood pH above or equal to 7.25, PCO2 below or equal to 45, and creatinine below or equal to 2. Much more of the observations were also white. Due to the large difference between groups some of these variables were not further explored, and the focus of exploratory data analysis and understanding of distribution was on variables where values might have been prior to admission. These might aid clinicians who work in the ICU in understanding the likelihood of survival for individuals who are admitted before lab work has been ordered.

6) Most patients admitted were conscious, with slighly more patients being comatose than in a deep stupor if unconscious. 

7) Looking at histograms of the three numerical variables in the dataset, which were Age, Systolic and HeartRate, it could be guess that if any of the distributions were to be normal, they would be Systolic and HeartRate. Age is very obviously not normally distributed. Systolic looks like it is centered around 140, and the mean confirms this as mentioned above. The mean of HeartRate seems to be centered around 100 and its mean confirms this visual estimate.

## Observations

  - The number of patient who live is higher than the population who died
  - More Patients from the population aged 50 and above died in both male and female
  - The female population experienced more death than men of the same age bracket as 
  - The density plot is peaked at the top at the age 75 for both male and female meaning more patients aged 75 died.


# Uniform Distribution   

The distribution of the ICU attributes will be explored below. Many of the attributes chosen to be tested here relate to the history of the individuals in the data set or the circumstances of the admission, rather than lab tests on admission. Most of the categorical attributes in this dataset have two categories, making the degrees of freedom 1 for chi squared distribution. 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap= "Theoretical chi square distribution with 1 degrees of freedom", out.width="70%" }
knitr::include_graphics("./eHealth 705 statkey chisq 1df.png")
```

For Categorical variables with two categories:    
__H0__: the attribute is distributed uniformally, the chi squared value does not exceed the hypothesized  value of 3.841 (p = 0.05)    
__Ha__: the attribute is not distiributed uniformally, The chi squared value exceeds the hypothesized value of 3.841    

__Chi squared test - Status__:  

The chi squared test for Status returns a chi squared value above the null hypothesized value with a very small p value (<0.05), indicating that there is a very low risk of Type I error if the null hypothesis is rejected. It can be concluded that Status is not uniformally distributed and that statistically more individuals lived than died on admission to the ICU.  

```{r}
local({
  .Table <- with(ICU, table(Status))
  cat("\ncounts:\n")
  print(.Table)
  cat("\npercentages:\n")
  print(round(100*.Table/sum(.Table), 
  2))
  .Probs <- c(0.5,0.5) 
  chisq.test(.Table, p=.Probs)
})
```

__Chi squared test - CPR__:   

Similarly, the chi squared test for CPR returns a very high chi squared value at 151, and a low p value, allowing us to reject the null hypothesis that this attribute is uniformally distributed. More individuals did not have CPR than did before ICU admission. In fact, as seen from the table below, few individuals received CPR at all, which might make it a poor predictor of ICU outcomes.

```{r}
local({
  .Table <- with(ICU, table(CPR))
  cat("\ncounts:\n")
  print(.Table)
  cat("\npercentages:\n")
  print(round(100*.Table/sum(.Table), 
  2))
  .Probs <- c(0.5,0.5) 
  chisq.test(.Table, p=.Probs)
})
```

```{r}
table(ICU$CPR, ICU$Status)
```

__Chi squared test - Infection__:   
 
The chi squared value produced from this test is only slightly higher than the null hypothesized value, with a p value of 0.024, indicating a 2.4% chance of a Type I error if the null hypothesis is rejected. While the distribution can be concluded to not be uniform based on the threshold set with the null hypothesis, the uniformity of Infection among patients admitted to the ICU could be explored in further research. It should be noted that in the group of individuals who died, more had infections than not.  

```{r}
local({
  .Table <- with(ICU, table(Infection))
  cat("\ncounts:\n")
  print(.Table)
  cat("\npercentages:\n")
  print(round(100*.Table/sum(.Table), 
  2))
  .Probs <- c(0.5,0.5) 
  chisq.test(.Table, p=.Probs)
})
```

```{r}
table(ICU$Infection, ICU$Status)
```

__Chi squared test - Previous__:   

The chi squared value here exceeds the null hypothesized value with a p value much smaller than 0.05, allowing us to reject the null hypothesis that this attribute is uniformally distributed. More individuals in both status categories did not have a previous ICU admission. 

```{r}
local({
  .Table <- with(ICU, table(Previous))
  cat("\ncounts:\n")
  print(.Table)
  cat("\npercentages:\n")
  print(round(100*.Table/sum(.Table), 
  2))
  .Probs <- c(0.5,0.5) 
  chisq.test(.Table, p=.Probs)
})
```

__Chi squared test - Sex__:   

The chi squared value returned from this test is 11.52, which is not as far from the null hypothesized value as some of the other values generated from other tests. The value and p value of 0.00069 still indicated that the null hypothesis should be reject and that Sex is not uniformally distributed. There are more men in this dataset than females.   

```{r}
local({
  .Table <- with(ICU, table(Sex))
  cat("\ncounts:\n")
  print(.Table)
  cat("\npercentages:\n")
  print(round(100*.Table/sum(.Table), 
  2))
  .Probs <- c(0.5,0.5) 
  chisq.test(.Table, p=.Probs)
})
```

In both sex categories, despite the inequality in the number of observations in each group, there are still more individuals who lived than died. 

__Chi squared test - Type__:

The distribution of Type can be concluded to be non-uniform as the null hypothesis should be rejected based on the chi squared value produced and low p value. As seen in exploratory data analysis, the there are more individuals who are had emergency admissions than elective admissions. This difference in distribution is statistically significant. Fewer individuals died when they were admitted to the ICU on an elective basis.  

```{r}
local({
  .Table <- with(ICU, table(Type))
  cat("\ncounts:\n")
  print(.Table)
  cat("\npercentages:\n")
  print(round(100*.Table/sum(.Table), 
  2))
  .Probs <- c(0.5,0.5) 
  chisq.test(.Table, p=.Probs)
})
```

__Chi squared test - Service__:

The distribution of Service is uniform based on the null hypothesis of a chi squared variable of 3.841. The chi squared value here indicates that there is not a significant difference between a uniform distribution and the distributio not Service. This means that there was no significant difference between the number of individuals admitted who had medical or surgical services performed, as the p value indicates a 32% risk of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis. 

```{r}
local({
  .Table <- with(ICU, table(Service))
  cat("\ncounts:\n")
  print(.Table)
  cat("\npercentages:\n")
  print(round(100*.Table/sum(.Table), 
  2))
  .Probs <- c(0.5,0.5) 
  chisq.test(.Table, p=.Probs)
})
```

For Categorical variables with three categories:    
__H0__: the attribute is distributed uniformally, the chi squared value does not exceed the hypothesized  value of 5.992 (p = 0.05)    
__Ha__: the attribute is not distiributed uniformally, The chi squared value exceeds the hypothesized value of 5.992 (p=0.05)    

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap= "Theoretical chi square distribution with 2 degrees of freedom", out.width="70%" }
knitr::include_graphics("./eHealth 705 statkey chisq 2df.png")
```

__Chi squared test - Consciousness__:

The null hypothesis for this attribute's distribution is that an equal number of observations will be found in each category of Consciousness. The chi squared value produced by this test exceeds the null hypothesized value with a low p value, indicating that the observations in this category are statistically not uniform. This could have been guessed from counts of observations in each category, where most individuals were in the conscious category. 

```{r}
local({
  .Table <- with(ICU, 
  table(Consciousness))
  cat("\ncounts:\n")
  print(.Table)
  cat("\npercentages:\n")
  print(round(100*.Table/sum(.Table), 
  2))
  .Probs <- c(0.333333333333333,
  0.333333333333333,0.333333333333333) 
  chisq.test(.Table, p=.Probs)
})
```

# Normal Distribution

Distribution of the three numerical variables in the ICU dataset was evaluated using quantile-quantile plots and the Shapiro-Wilk's test for normality. Confidence intervals will be produced for the means of each attribute.   

__H0__: Age, HeartRate and Systolic are normally distributed   
__Ha__: Age, HeartRate and Systolic are not normally distributed 

Tests of normality - Age:     

Recall that a quantile-quantile plot should produce a nearly linear plot using dataset values, with the intercept going through zero, if the null hypothesis is satisfied. Below, the plotted points of Age do not conform well to the line of best fit, and are frequently outside of the confidence bands. This supports what might have been hypothesized when the histogram of Age was produced: this distribution is not clearly centered around a mean. This plot suggests that the null hypothesis that Age is normally distributed should be rejected. 

```{r}
with(ICU, qqPlot(Age, dist="norm", id=list(method="y", n=2, labels=rownames(ICU)), main="QQ plot of Age"))
```

Using the Shapiro-Wilk normality test, the conclusions drawn from the QQ plot can be supported, with a very low risk of Type I error, base on this p value. The Shapiro Wilk test is sensitive when used on larger datasets, so this result should be taken into account with the other tests used. 

```{r}
normalityTest(~Age, test="shapiro.test", data=ICU)
```

Using the t-test, given the confidence interval for this attribute is between 54.75 and 60.34, an interval that does not contain 0. (choosing not to add this as I do not have a test mean - need to refresh on what a true mean is )

Tests of normality - HeartRate: 

The QQ plot of HeartRate appears to adhere well to the line of best fit, despite several points in the middle of the graph lying along one side of the confidence band. Most of the points here fall within the confidence band. There is a positive skew of this data towards the lower values of HeartRate. Visually, one might conclude that this data is normally distributed. 
```{r}
with(ICU, qqPlot(HeartRate, dist="norm", id=list(method="y", n=2, labels=rownames(ICU)), main="QQ plot of HeartRate"))
```
The results of the Shapiro-Wilk test very narrowly allow one to reject the null hypothesis of normal distribution. However the p value is very close to the threshold p value of 0.05, which decreases the confidence that might be had to reject normality based on this test and the sample size used.  
```{r}
normalityTest(~HeartRate, test="shapiro.test", data=ICU)
```

Test of normality - Systolic:

Similar to the plot of HeartRate, the QQ plot of Systolic displays points that line closely on the line of best fit. The confidence bands here are quite narrow, and it is only along the ends oof the plot the points very clearly exit the confidence bands. One might conclude that the null hypothesis could be rejected for the normal distribution of Systolic based on this plot. There is a very slight negative skew here towards higher values of Systolic.   

```{r}
with(ICU, qqPlot(Systolic, dist="norm", id=list(method="y", n=2, labels=rownames(ICU)), main="QQ Plot of Systolic"))
``` 

While more statistically significant compared to the Shapiro Wilk test for normality of the HeartRate distribution, the p value here is not far from 0.05, indicating a 2% risk of Type I error. Based on this test, the null hypothesis could be rejected. The distribution of Systolic appears to be non-normal. 

```{r}
normalityTest(~Systolic, test="shapiro.test", data=ICU)
```

In reference to Ian Fellows' comments about tests for normality, these tests for normality do not add much more to understanding of the ICU dataset and the contributions of these three numerical variables to the determination of Status, beyond what is provided by the xray package. In the same vein, as the central limit theorem and bootstrapping have shown, most distributions can become normal with repeated sampling. 


## Relationships with Age 

The mean of Age, referring to the descriptive statistics for this attributes, is about 58 years. Visually, it can be seen that the distribution of Age has two peaks, one around 20 years of age and one around 70 years of age. The majority of subjects admitted to the ICU seem to be between 40-80 years old. 

```{r}
ggplot(ICU, aes(x=Age)) +
 geom_density(fill="green") +
 ggtitle("Age") +
 theme(axis.title.x=element_text(size=16, face="bold", colour="blue")) +
 theme(axis.text.x=element_text(size=14 )) +
 annotate("text", x=0.8, y=-0.001, label="Base=315",  size=4)

There are three peaks for of Ages where ICU admissions involved cancer. These are around 20, 50 and 70 years of age. Given the relatively small number of individuals who had cancer involvement with their admission, and the variability in ages associated, cancer might not be the best predictor of ICU admission. 


```{r}
ggplot(ICU, aes(x=Age, fill = Cancer)) +
  theme_bw() +
      geom_density(alpha=0.5) +
  labs(y = "Density",
       title = "Density distribution of Cancer by Age")
```

ICU admissions that involved infection centered around 60-65 years of age. This associations is relatively clear visually looking at the plot below. 

```{r}
ggplot(ICU, aes(x=Age, fill = Infection )) +
  theme_bw() +
      geom_density(alpha=0.5) +
  labs(y = "Density",
       title = "Density distribution of Infection by Age")
```

### Consciousness by Age

Another association that was explored was between Age and Consiousness. All three categories for Consciousness overlap with peaks between 50 and 75 years of age. There is a distinct peak at around 50 for deep stupor, indicating that this age might be associated with deep stupor when related to ICU admissions. However, deep stupor also has a secondary peak at around 75, which make it less clearly how this consciousness category relates to age in this dataset. 

```{r}
ggplot(ICU, aes(x=Age, fill = Consciousness )) +
  theme_bw() +
      geom_density(alpha=0.5) +
  labs(y = "Density",
       title = "Density distribution of Consciousness by Age")
```

### Type by Age

Both admission Types, elective and emergency, happen more frequently with advancing age. However, elective admissions happen more frequently with older age. This might suggest that older individuals are more likely to have complications during surgical or other procedures that would require admissions to an intensive care unit. Depending on organizational policy or practice, this might also mean that individuals at the study site were premptively admitted to ICU, perhaps more frequently with advancing age, for fear of complications. 

```{r}
ggplot(ICU, aes(x=Age, fill = Type )) +
  theme_bw() +
      geom_density(alpha=0.5) +
  labs(y = "Density",
       title = "Density distribution of Type by Age")
```

### Service by Age

While the peaks for surgical and medical Service by Age overlap considerably, there is interestingly a peak of surgical service type in younger age groups, around 20 years of age. While it is not known what conditions led to these individuals being admitted, it might be concluded that older individual would have more events that were related to their medication or needing medication, for example falls or stroke. This is a very weak conclusion to draw from the graph below, but if specific reasons for admission were also collected, this theory could be explored. 

```{r}
ggplot(ICU, aes(x=Age, fill = Service)) +
  theme_bw() +
      geom_density(alpha=0.5) +
  labs(y = "Density",
       title = "Density distribution of Service by Age")
```

### Previous by Age

There is a definite an almost independent peak of history of previous ICU admission with older age. It can be noted that there is a smaller peak of relatively older individuals who were admitted who had not had a previous ICU admission. This indicates that old age doe not relate clearly to previous ICU admission and future ICU admission. On the extremes of age, younger individuals are shown to have less frequency of previous ICU admission, while there is a small peak of older admission of the individuals in this dataset having had a previous ICU admission. There might be a smaller increased likelihood of ICU admission with previous ICU admission with age. 
```{r}
ggplot(ICU, aes(x=Age, fill = Previous )) +
  theme_bw() +
      geom_density(alpha=0.5) +
  labs(y = "Density",
       title = "Density distribution of Previous by Age")
```

### Sex by Age

From the plot below, it seems that females who were admitted to the ICU were older than their male counterparts. There are similar peaks and patterns for younger individuals: females were older if admitted to ICU than their male counterparts.
```{r}
ggplot(ICU, aes(x=Age, fill = Sex)) +
  theme_bw() +
      geom_density(alpha=0.5) +
  labs(y = "Density",
       title = "Density distribution of Sex by Age")
```

__H0__: the variances for Lived and Died are equal  
__Ha__: the variances are different

__H0__: the means are equal  
__Ha__: the means are different

The following is the comparison of variances between the two Sex groups for Age.

```{r}
with(ICU, tapply(Age, Sex, var, na.rm=TRUE))
```

The following code produces the result of the LeveneTest for testing homogeneity of variances.
```{r}
leveneTest(Age ~ Sex, data=ICU, center="median")
```

Since the p-value = 0.7344 for testing the homogeneity of variances is greater than 0.05, we retain the null hypothesis with a 5% risk of a type 1 error and conclude that the variances for Lived and Died are equal. As such, the Student t-test is used to analyze whether there was a significant difference in means.
8
```{r}
t.test(Age~Sex, alternative='two.sided', conf.level=.95, var.equal=TRUE, data=ICU)
qt(c(0.025), df=314, lower.tail=TRUE)
```

As the p-value = 0.1759, 0 is within the confidence intervals of -9.708824 to 1.789469 and t = -1.3582 is greater than - 1.9675, we retain the null hypothesis at a 5% risk level of a type 1 error and conclude that the means for systolic blood pressure are the same between the two groups.


### Status by Age
Overlaying Status and Age, density plots show that deaths after admission follow the larger Age peak that contains middle aged to elderly individuals. 

```{r}
ggplot(ICU, aes(x=Age, fill = Status)) +
  theme_bw() +
      geom_density(alpha=0.5) +
  labs(y = "Density",
       title = "Density distribution of Vital Status by Age")
```

When the additional layer of Status, more information can be gathered from the relationship between Age and Sex. When looking at males, older males more often died than younger males, with similar frequency in advanced age, around the age of 65-70. In younger males, those admitted to the ICU were more often to have lived through their admission, where the opposite is seen in older males. 

In females, there is a clearer distribution of older individuals who had died. No females in this dataset under the age of about 40 died on ICU admission. There is a clear peak at around 75 years and a smaller peak at around 50 of females who died on ICU admission. There is a higher frequency of younger females who lived through ICU admission, but there remains a higher frequency of women who were older in this group. 

```{r}
ggplot(ICU, aes(x=Age, fill = Status)) +
   theme_bw() +
   facet_wrap(~ Sex) +
       geom_density(alpha=0.5) +
   labs(y = "Density",
        title = "Density distribution of Vital Status in male and female patients by Age")
```

__H0__: the variances for Lived and Died are equal  
__Ha__: the variances are different

__H0__: the means are equal  
__Ha__: the means are different

The following is the comparison of variances between the two Status groups for Age.

```{r}
with(ICU, tapply(Age, Status, var, na.rm=TRUE))
```

The following code produces the result of the LeveneTest for testing homogeneity of variances.

```{r}
leveneTest(Age ~ Status, data=ICU, center="median")
```

Since the p value = 0.07855 for testing the homogeneity of variances is greater than 0.05, we retain the null hypothesis with a 5% risk of a type 1 error and conclude that the variances for Lived and Died are equal. As such, the Student t-test is used to analyze whether there was a significant difference in means.

```{r}
t.test(Age~Status, alternative='two.sided', conf.level=.95, var.equal=TRUE, data=ICU)
qt(c(0.025), df=314, lower.tail=TRUE)
```

As the p-value = 0.007211, 0 is not within the confidence intervals of -16.35688 to -2.59312 and t = -2.7151 is less than -1.967548, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the means for Age for the groups Lived and Died are not the same. 


## Relationships with HeartRate

Using a density estimate plot, the distribution of HeartRate was produced. The main peak here is at about 90 beats per minute. There appears to be secondary peak around 130 beats per minute. The mean for HeartRate calculated by Rcmdr is 99. Looking at the data, this mean might be said to not accurately portray the frequency of values for HearRate. 

```{r}
 ggplot(ICU, aes(x=HeartRate)) +
 geom_density(fill="green") +
 ggtitle("HeartRate") +
 theme(axis.title.x=element_text(size=16, face="bold", colour="blue")) +
 theme(axis.text.x=element_text(size=14 )) +
 annotate("text", x=0.8, y=-0.001, label="Base=315",  size=4)
```

### Vital Status by Heart Rate

Both status categories have similar peaks when plotted on a density estimate plot of HeartRate. This indicates that there might not be a difference in the Status response category based on HeartRate. People who lived did seem to have a higher density of HeartRate values around 90 than those who died. A normal adult heart rate rangest between 60 and 100 beats per minute. This graph might suggest that people who lived more often had heartrates within this range, whereas those who died seemed more likely to have higher heartrates. This could inform further analysis or research. 

```{r}
ggplot(ICU, aes(x=HeartRate, fill = Status)) +
  theme_bw() +
      geom_density(alpha=0.5) +
  labs(y = "Density",
       title = "Density distribution of Vital Status by HeartRate")
```

__H0__: the variances for Lived and Died are equal  
__Ha__: the variances are different

__H0__: the means are equal  
__Ha__: the means are different

The following is the comparison of variances between the two Status groups for HeartRate.
```{r}
with(ICU, tapply(HeartRate, Status, var, na.rm=TRUE))
```

The following code produces the result of the LeveneTest for testing homogeneity of variances.
```{r}
leveneTest(HeartRate ~ Status, data=ICU, center="median")
```

Since the p-value = 0.929 for testing the homogeneity of variances is greater than 0.05, we retain the null hypothesis with a 5% risk of a type 1 error and conclude that the variances for Lived and Died are equal. As such, the Student t-test is used to analyze whether there was a significant difference in means.

```{r}
t.test(HeartRate~Status, alternative='two.sided', conf.level=.95, var.equal=TRUE, data=ICU)
qt(c(0.025), df=314, lower.tail=TRUE)
```

As the p-value = 0.6553, 0 is within the confidence intervals of -11.496845 to 7.246845 and t = -0.44714 is greater than -1.967548, we retain the null hypothesis at a 5% risk level of a type 1 error and conclude that the means for HeartRate are the same among those that lived and those that died. 


## Relationships with Systolic

Below is a density plot of Systolic blood pressure in mmHg. A peak appears around 130-140mmHg. The peak is quite narrow and distinct compared to the density plots of Age and HeartRate, suggesting that the majority of individuals had blood pressure readings that are reflective of this plot. The mean for this attribute was 132mmHg, which seems to be more valid than the means of the other numeric variables, based on the distribution of the frequency of values. 

```{r}
ggplot(ICU, aes(x=Systolic)) +
 geom_density(fill="green") +
 ggtitle("Systolic") +
 theme(axis.title.x=element_text(size=16, face="bold", colour="blue")) +
 theme(axis.text.x=element_text(size=14 )) +
 annotate("text", x=0.8, y=-0.001, label="Base=315",  size=4)
```

### Status by Systolic
The distribution of Systolic values for those who died seem to be concentrated around 75 mmHg and 140mmHg. A normal Systolic blood pressure can vary widely but the American Heart Association states that blood pressure below 120mmHg is normal. However, excessively low blood pressure could be a result of bleeding, for example, and can result in insufficient blood flow to critical organs. Medications used to restore blood pressure are used when blood pressure becomes too low. This might explain the peak around 75mmHg in the death curve in the graph below. 

```{r}
ggplot(ICU, aes(x=Systolic, fill = Status)) +
  theme_bw() +
      geom_density(alpha=0.5) +
  labs(y = "Density",
       title = "Density distribution of Vital Status Systolic")
```
__H0__: the variances for Lived and Died are equal  
__Ha__: the variances are different  

__H0__: the means are equal  
__Ha__: the means are different

The following is the comparison of variances between the two Status groups for Systolic.
```{r}
with(ICU, tapply(Systolic, Status, var, na.rm=TRUE))
```

The following code produces the result of the LeveneTest for testing homogeneity of variances.
```{r}
leveneTest(Systolic ~ Status, data=ICU, center="median")
```

Since the p-value = 0.04205 for testing the homogeneity of variances is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis with a 5% risk of a type 1 error and conclude that the variances for Lived and Died are not equal. As such, the Welch two Sample t-test is used to analyze whether there was a significant difference in means. 

```{r}
t.test(Systolic~Status, alternative="two.sided", conf.level=.95, var.equal=FALSE, data=ICU)
qt(c(0.025), df=314, lower.tail=TRUE)
```

As the p-value = 0.01856, 0 is not within the confidence intervals of  2.938642 to 30.698858 and t = 2.4341 is greater than 1.9675, we reject the null hypothesis at a 5% risk level of a type 1 error and conclude that the means for systolic blood pressure are not the same among those that lived and those that died. 

# Difference in proportions

We will conduct z-tests between two categorical variables where the dependent variable is Vital status and the independent variable is binary.

Vital status by Service

__H0__: there is no difference between the proportion of patients that died in the medical versus surgical group, risk = 0.05
__Ha__: there is a difference between the proportion of patients that died in the medical versus surgical group

```{r}
pacman::p_load(sjPlot)
sjt.xtab(ICU$Status, ICU$Service, show.col.prc = TRUE)
```

```{r}
x1<-26; x2<-14; n1<-93; n2<-107
p1<-x1/n1; p2<-x2/n2
p<-(x1+x2)/(n1+n2)  
varp<-p*(1-p)*(1/n1 + 1/n2)  
stdp<-sqrt(varp)  
zp<-(p1 - p2)/stdp 
zp
1-pnorm(zp)
```

When conducting a two-tail z-test with a 5% level of risk of a type 1 error, the critical values are -1.96 and +1.96. The z-value of 2.622729 does not fall within this confidence interval, thus we reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the proportion of patients dying in the ICU from medical procedures versus surgical procedures. 

Further, since the p-value of 0.004361436 is less than 0.05, we, again, reject the null hypothesis that the proportions of the two groups are equal. 

Lastly, we can see from the table that more of those that died were there for a medical service and more of those that lived were there for a surgical service.

Vital status by Cancer

__H0__: there is no difference between the proportions of patients that died in the cancer versus non-cancer group, risk = 0.05
__Ha__: there is a difference between the proportions of patients that died in the cancer versus non-cancer group

```{r}
pacman::p_load(sjPlot)
sjt.xtab(ICU$Status, ICU$Cancer, show.col.prc = TRUE)
```

```{r}
x1<-36; x2<-4; n1<-180; n2<-20
p1<-x1/n1; p2<-x2/n2
p<-(x1+x2)/(n1+n2)  
varp<-p*(1-p)*(1/n1 + 1/n2)  
stdp<-sqrt(varp)  
zp<-(p1 - p2)/stdp 
zp
1-pnorm(zp)
```

When conducting a two-tail z-test with a 5% level of risk of a type 1 error, the critical values are -1.96 and +1.96. The z-value of 0 falls within this confidence interval, thus we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the proportions of patients that died with versus without cancer as part of the present problem.

Further, since the p-value of 0.5 is greater than 0.05, we, again, fail to reject the null hypothesis that the proportions of the Cancer versus non-cancer patients that died are equal.

Thus, there are equal proportions of those who died with cancer as part of the present problem and without, as well as equal proportions of those who lived with cancer as part of the present problem and without.

Vital status by Previous

__H0__: there is no difference between the proportion of patients that died with versus without previous admission to an ICU within 6 months, risk = 0.05
__Ha__: there is a difference between the proportion of patients that died with versus without previous admission to an ICU within 6 months

```{r}
pacman::p_load(sjPlot)
sjt.xtab(ICU$Status, ICU$Previous, show.col.prc = TRUE)
```

```{r}
x1<-33; x2<-7; n1<-170; n2<-30
p1<-x1/n1; p2<-x2/n2
p<-(x1+x2)/(n1+n2)  
varp<-p*(1-p)*(1/n1 + 1/n2)  
stdp<-sqrt(varp)  
zp<-(p1 - p2)/stdp 
zp
1-pnorm(zp)
```

When conducting a two-tail z-test with a 5% level of risk of a type 1 error, the critical values are -1.96 and +1.96. The z-value of -0.4950738 falls within this confidence interval, thus we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the proportion of patients that died with versus without previous admission to an ICU within 6 months of the current admission. 

Further, since the p-value of 0.689726 is greater than 0.05, we, again, fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the proportion of patients that died whether or not they were previously admitted to the ICU within the past 6 months.

Lastly, we see from the table that there was a lower percentage of patients that died with no prior ICU admission than patients that died with prior ICU admission.

Vital status by Type

Ho: there is no difference between the proportion of patients that died in the elective admission group versus the emergency admission group, risk = 0.05
Ha: there is a difference between the proportion of patients that died in the elective admission group versus the emergency admission group

```{r}
pacman::p_load(sjPlot)
sjt.xtab(ICU$Status, ICU$Type, show.col.prc = TRUE)
```

```{r}
x1<-2; x2<-38; n1<-53; n2<-147
p1<-x1/n1; p2<-x2/n2
p<-(x1+x2)/(n1+n2)  
varp<-p*(1-p)*(1/n1 + 1/n2)  
stdp<-sqrt(varp)  
zp<-(p1 - p2)/stdp 
zp
pnorm(zp)
```

When conducting a two-tail z-test with a 5% level of risk of a type 1 error, the critical values are -1.96 and +1.96. The z-value of -3.444743 does not fall within this confidence interval, thus we reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the proportion of patients that died in the elective admission group versus the emergency admission group.

Further, since the p-value of 0.000285801 is less than 0.05, we, again, reject the null hypothesis that the proportions of the two groups are equal. 

We can see from the table that the emergency admission type had a higher proportion of deaths than the elective admission type did.

We will now conduct a prop.test for categorical variables where the independent variable has more than 2 subgroups.

Vital status by Age

__H0__: there is no difference between the proportion of patients that died across the 5 age groups, risk = 0.05
__Ha__: the proportion of patients that died is different in at least one of the 5 age groups


```{r}
pacman::p_load(sjPlot)
sjt.xtab(ICU$Status, ICU$Age.binned, show.col.prc = TRUE)
```

```{r}
Died  <- c( 3, 8, 9, 11, 9 )
Total <- c( 41, 39, 43, 44, 33 )
prop.test(Died, Total)
```

Since the p-value of 0.2044 is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the proportion of patients that died across the 5 age groups. We can see from the sample estimates that the proportions are indeed quite similar between the 5 age groups. However, the number of patients that died in age group 1 (the youngest age group) is much lower than the rest. The greatest proportion of patients that died is in group 5 (the oldest age group). The proportions in groups 2 and 3 are quite similar and slightly higher in group 4. However, overall, most of the groups had similar proportions of patients that died, aside from the youngest age group.

Further, when conducting a chi-square test with a 5% level of risk of a type 1 error and 4 degrees of freedom, the critical value is 9.49. Since the chi-squared value of 5.93 is less than this critical value, we, again, fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the proportion of patients that died across the 5 age groups.


Vital status by Systolic Blood Pressure

__H0__: there is no difference between the proportion of patients that died across the 6 systolic blood pressure level groups, risk = 0.05
__Ha__: the proportion of patients that died is different in at least one of the 6 systolic blood pressure level groups


```{r}
pacman::p_load(sjPlot)
sjt.xtab(ICU$Status, ICU$Systolic.grouped, show.col.prc = TRUE)
```

```{r}
Died  <- c( 3, 9, 9, 6, 11, 2 )
Total <- c( 17, 12, 61, 30, 65, 15 )
prop.test(Died, Total)
```

Since the p-value of 0.0001667 is less than 0.05, we will reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the proportion of patients that died in the 6 systolic blood pressure level groups. We can see from the sample estimates that the proportions are indeed different between the 6 groups, with the highest proportion in the hypotenstion range and in the stage 1 hypertension range. The proportions in the elevated, normal, stage 2 hypertension and stage 3 hypertension groups are much lower and are quite close to each other. Thus, the hypotension and stage 1 hypertension groups had higher proportions of patients that died. 

Further, when conducting a chi-square test with a 5% level of risk of a type 1 error and 5 degrees of freedom, the critical value is 11.07. Since the chi-squared value of 24.597 is greater than this critical value, we will, again, reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the proportion of patients that died in the 6 systolic blood pressure level groups.

Vital status by Heart Rate

__H0__: there is no difference between the proportion of patients that died across the bradychardia, normal heart rate and elevated heart rate groups, risk = 0.05
__Ha__: the proportion of patients that died is different in at least one of the 3 heart rate categories


```{r}
pacman::p_load(sjPlot)
sjt.xtab(ICU$Status, ICU$HeartRate.grouped, show.col.prc = TRUE)
```

```{r}
Died  <- c( 3, 16, 21 )
Total <- c( 15, 80, 105 )
prop.test(Died, Total)
```

Since the p-value of 1 is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference between proportion of patients that died across the bradychardia, normal heart rate and elevated heart rate groups. An exact p-value of 1 means that the difference in proportions of patients that died between the 3 heart rate groups is exactly 0. Thus, there were an equal number of patients that died with bradycardia, normal heart rate and elevated heart rate.

Further, when conducting a chi-square test with a 5% level of risk of a type 1 error and 2 degrees of freedom, the critical value is 5.99. Since the chi-squared value of 0 is lower than this critical value, we, again, fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the proportion of patients that died having bradychardia, normal heart rate and elevated heart rate.

Vital status by Race

__H0__: there is no difference between the proportion of patients that died that were White, Black or otherwise, risk = 0.05
__Ha__: the proportion of patients that died is different in at least one of the race categories

```{r}
pacman::p_load(sjPlot)
sjt.xtab(ICU$Status, ICU$Race, show.col.prc = TRUE)
```

```{r}
Died  <- c( 37, 1, 2 )
Total <- c( 175, 15, 10 )
prop.test(Died, Total)
```

Since the p-value of 0.4046 is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the proportion of patients that died that were White, Black or otherwise.

Further, when conducting a chi-square test with a 5% level of risk of a type 1 error and 2 degrees of freedom, the critical value is 5.99. Since the chi-squared value of 1.8095 is less than this critical value, we, again, fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the proportion of patients that died that were White, Black or otherwise.

When looking at the sample estimates and at the table, we see that there was almost no difference between the proportion of White patients that died and the proportion of 'Other' patients that died. However, the proportion of Black patients that died was slightly lower than the White and 'Other' groups.

Vital status by Consciousness

__H0__: there is no difference between the proportion of patients that died across the Conscious, Deep Stupor and Coma groups, risk = 0.05
__Ha__: the proportion of patients that died is different in at least one of the Conscious, Deep Stupor and Coma groups

```{r}
pacman::p_load(sjPlot)
sjt.xtab(ICU$Status, ICU$Consciousness, show.col.prc = TRUE)
```

```{r}
Died  <- c( 27, 5, 8 )
Total <- c( 185, 5, 10 )
prop.test(Died, Total)
```

Since the p-value of 1.091e-10 is less than 0.05, we will reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the proportion of patients that died across the Conscious, Deep Stupor and Coma groups. 

Further, when conducting a chi-square test with a 5% level of risk of a type 1 error and 2 degrees of freedom, the critical value is 5.99. Since the chi-squared value of 45.878 is greater than this critical value, we will, again, reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the proportion of patients that died across the 3 Consciousness groups.

With a proportion of 1, the Deep Stupor group had the highest proportion of patients that died as all the patients with a deep stupor died. The Coma group has the second highest proportion of patients that died with a sample estimate of 80% dying. The lowest number of deaths was in the group of patients that had no coma or stupor, which is expected. Those with a deep stupor had a higher proportion of deaths than those in a coma.

From the tests of equal proportions, we note that the the following variables had a statistically significant impact on the Vital status of the patient: Service (type of procedure), Type (of admission) and Conciousness.

The following variables were not significant predictors of Vital status of the patient:  Cancer, Previous (ICU admission within the last 6 months), Age, Systolic Blood Pressure, Heart Rate and Race.

## Detection of outliers of Int Variables

Statistically significant crosstabs include: Creatinine, Type, CPR, Infection,Renal, Service. 
We will also conduct the Goodman Kruskall's Lambda test to measure the proportional reduction in error in the crosstabs conducted above. As we can see in the lambda calculation below, there is a weak association between the dependent and independent variable, as the lambda is higher than 0 but lower than 1, in which the latter would denote a strong relationship. 
```{r}
ICUtable<-as.table(cbind(c(ICU$Service, ICU$Cancer, ICU$Previous, ICU$Type, ICU$Age.binned, ICU$Systolic.grouped, ICU$HeartRate.grouped, ICU$Consciousness, ICU$CPR, ICU$Infection, ICU$Sex, ICU$Renal), c(ICU$Status)))
Lambda(ICUtable, direction=c("symmetric", "row", "column"), conf.level = 0.95)
```
## Logistic Regression 
In order to deduce the model that will predict the outcome of the status based on our chosen variables, we had decided to conduct a logistic regression, due to the fact that our respondent variable is binomial. 

According to our logistic regression model below, statistically significant indicators include age, cancer, systolic blood pressure, type, service, previous and consciousness. The large enough difference between the null and residual deviance provides us with some confidence in our model, although our confidence intervals do not as they have 0 in them. However, before we state our model based on the calculations below, we will reduce our model to its significant predictors, and further investigate whether our model is sturdy. 

```{r}
ICU.m<-glm(formula=Status~Age.binned+Sex+Service+Cancer+Renal+Infection+CPR+Systolic.grouped+HeartRate.grouped+Previous+Type+PO2+Consciousness, family=binomial(logit), data=ICU)
summary(ICU.m)
confint(ICU.m)
exp(coef(ICU.m))
```


### Final model 
As stated above, we wanted to reduce our model to a final model, based on its significant predictors. 

As we can see below, the predictors are still significant, and the difference between the null and residual deviance are still large enough to provide us with some confidence in our model, while our confidence intervals still do not. However, this does not mean that we won't test the strength of our final model, which we will do below. 
```{r}
ICU.final.m<-glm(formula=Status~Age.binned+Service+Cancer+Systolic.grouped+Consciousness+Previous+Type, family=binomial(logit),data=ICU)
summary(ICU.final.m)
confint(ICU.final.m)
exp(coef(ICU.final.m))
```
### How strong is our model? 
We will assess our model by dividing it into training and testing samples. This way, we can assess how good our model is at predicting results in the testing sample, while also further scrutinizing our training and testing model. 

### Testing & training the model 
Below we have split our ICU dataset into training and testing datasets, with 150 observations in the former, and 50 in the latter. 
```{r}
pacman::p_load(rsample,DT)
set.seed(78)
train_test_split <- initial_split(ICU)
train <- training(train_test_split)
test <- testing(train_test_split)
(samp <- dim(train_test_split))
datatable(train)
```

Below we have conducted a logistic regression on our training dataset, using the finalized coefficients that we have deduced above. We can observe below that intercept, age, cancer, consciousness, service, previous and type are statistically significant. However, systolic is no longer statistically significant. Yet, the large difference between the null and residual deviance leads us with some confidence in our model. 
```{r}
ICU.tr<-glm(Status~Age.binned+Service+Cancer+Systolic.grouped+Previous+Consciousness+Type, family=binomial(logit),data=train)
summary(ICU.tr)
exp(coef(ICU.tr))
```

As we can see below, where we have used the training model to predict the models in the testing dataset, we do get mixed results regarding the statistical significance of the predictors based on the CIs. For example, all predictors are positive as we can see above, yet only age binned group 5, cancer,consciousness coma, previous, and type have their lower CIs above 1. Intercept does not have a lower coefficient above 1, nor does systolic thus further cementing the fact that it is not statistically significant. 
```{r}
predicted.val<-predict(ICU.tr, newdata=test)
head(predicted.val)

predicted.prob <- predict(ICU.tr, test, type = "response")
head( predict( ICU.tr, test, type="response") )

predicted.classes <- ifelse( predicted.prob > 0.5, "Lived", "Dead" )
head(predicted.classes)

tab_model(
  ICU.tr,
  title = "Logistic Regression Odds Ratios for Status using the Training Sample",
  show.stat = TRUE,
  digits = 3,
  string.stat = "z-value",
  string.p = "p (sig)",
  show.fstat = TRUE,
  show.dev = TRUE,
  show.aic = TRUE,
  CSS = list(
    css.depvarhead = 'color: red;',
    css.centeralign = 'text-align: left;',
    css.firsttablecol = 'font-weight: bold;',
    css.summary = 'color: blue;'
  )
)

plot_model(
  ICU.tr,
  title = "Logistic Regression of State of Status using the Training Sample",
  show.p = TRUE
)  + ylim(0, 800)

#ICU.tr$fitted.values[6:10]
```

With regards to the multicollinearity present within the model, according to the VIFs below, none are equal to 4, thus demonstrating the lack of multicollinarity in this model. 
```{r}
pacman::p_load(car,corrplot)
vf<-vif(ICU.tr)
vf

```

Although we have deduced that there is no multicollinearity present, we will now test the model against the null model, based on the training data. Below, we see that it's intercept is still significant. 
```{r}
fit0<-glm(Status~1, family=binomial(logit), data=train)
summary(fit0)
```

Below, however, we attempt to fit all of the predictors, using the training data. We still see that the all of the predictors are statistically significant, thus demonstrating that this model is worth pursuing. This is further confirmed by the ANOVA chi-square conducted below, which is also statistically significant. 
```{r}
fitall<-glm(Status~Age.binned+Service+Cancer+Systolic.grouped+Previous+Consciousness+Type, family=binomial(logit), data=train)
summary(fitall)
```
```{r}
anova(fitall, fit0, test="Chisq")
```

We have also conducted a Wald test to test the significance of the predictors in the training model as well. According to the results, cancer, type,consciousness, and previous are statistically significant. 
```{r}
pacman::p_load(survey)
regTermTest(ICU.tr, "Age.binned")
regTermTest(ICU.tr, "Cancer")
regTermTest(ICU.tr, "Systolic.grouped")
regTermTest(ICU.tr, "Type")
regTermTest(ICU.tr, "Service")
regTermTest(ICU.tr, "Consciousness")
regTermTest(ICU.tr, "Previous")
```
Now that we have deduced that our model is indeed robust, we will now move on to deduce our classificantion and regression trees, based on our variables of interest.


## Classification and Regression Trees 
As we can see below, the variables of interest are age, systolic, service and type. Pruning the tree doesn't seem plausible, as the xerror is steady from lines 2 to 4 and our cp graph denotes a stable cp from size 3 to 7, while the mean acuracy for our regression tree is 0.88. 
```{r}
pacman::p_load(rpart, rpart.plot, rattle, dplyr)
set.seed(2715)

#final model 
icutree=rpart(Status~Age.binned+Cancer+Systolic.grouped+Type+Consciousness+Type+Service+Renal+Infection+CPR+HeartRate.grouped+Previous+Consciousness, method="class", data=ICU)
#rpart.plot(icutree,
           #extra = 104, # show fitted class, probs, percentages
           #box.palette = "GnYlRd", # color scheme
           #prefix = "Status\n",
           #branch.lty = 1, # solid branch lines, 3 = dotted
           #shadow.col = "gray", # shadows under the node boxes
           #split.prefix = "is ", # put "is " before split text
           #split.suffix = "?", # put "?" after split text
           #nn = TRUE, # display the node numbers
           #tweak = 1.2)
fancyRpartPlot(icutree)
printcp(icutree)

predicted.classes <- icutree %>% predict(, data=icu, type = "class")
head(predicted.classes, 12)

mean(predicted.classes == ICU$Status)
plotcp(icutree)

par(mfrow=c(1,2)) 
rsq.rpart(icutree)

```

### Classification tree built on training data 
Below is our classification tree built on our training data. While our tree has 3 branches, the X error rises from line 2 to line 3, indicating that our training regression tree needs to be pruned, which according to our cp plot is around 2 splits. 
```{r}
icutree.train=rpart(Status~Service+Cancer+Previous+Type+Age.binned+Systolic.grouped+HeartRate.grouped+Consciousness+CPR+Infection+Sex+Renal, method="class", data=train, minsplit=20)
fancyRpartPlot(icutree.train)
plotcp(icutree.train)
par(mfrow=c(1,2)) 
rsq.rpart(icutree.train) 

```

```{r}
trainfit<-prune(icutree.train,cp=icutree.train$cptable[which.min(icutree.train$cptable[,"xerror"]),"CP"])
fancyRpartPlot(trainfit, palettes = "YlOrRd" , caption=NULL  )
```

###Prediction accuracy of our full model on training data
According to our results below, the prediction accuracy based on training data is statistically significant, with an 87 percent accuracy for predicting lived and dead patients in the ICU. 
```{r}
tree.pred.train.full=predict(icutree.train, newdata=train, type="class")

table_mat_full<-table(train$Status, tree.pred.train.full)

sjt.xtab(train$Status, tree.pred.train.full, var.labels=c("Actual Status", "Predicted Status"), show.row.prc = TRUE)

(accuracy_Train_Test <- sum(diag(table_mat_full)) / sum(table_mat_full))
```

However, when we build our model on the testing data, we get 72% accuracy, and a non-significant result. 
```{r}
tree.pred.test.full = predict(icutree.train, newdata=test, type = "class")
table_mat_tr_full <- table(test$Status, tree.pred.test.full)
sjt.xtab(test$Status, tree.pred.test.full, var.labels = c("Actual Status", "Predicted Status"), show.row.prc = TRUE)

(accuracy_Train_Test_full <- sum(diag(table_mat_tr_full)) / sum(table_mat_tr_full))
```

Finally, the classification rules based on the training sample are below: 
```{r}
rpart.rules(trainfit)
```

Specifically, we should expect 13 percent to die based if consciousness is conscious, and 83 percent to die if consciousness is deep stupor or coma.
